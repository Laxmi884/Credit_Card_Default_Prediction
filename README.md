# Credit_Card_Default_Prediction
In this project we develop a model in which we predict how likely is a customer to be a defaulter. 
Tools being used: Python, Alteryx

Problem Statement: This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments in Taiwan. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients.
